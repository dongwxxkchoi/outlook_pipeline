Hey dongwxxkchoi!

A sign in attempt requires further verification because we did not recognize =
your device. To complete the sign in, enter the verification code on the unre=
cognized device.

Device: Safari on macOS
Verification code: 342680

If you did not attempt to sign in to your account, your password may be compr=
omised. Visit https://github.com/settings/security to create a new, strong pa=
ssword for your GitHub account.

If you'd like to automatically verify devices in the future, consider enablin=
g two-factor authentication on your account. Visit https://docs.github.com/ar=
ticles/configuring-two-factor-authentication to learn about two-factor authen=
tication.

If you decide to enable two-factor authentication, ensure you retain access t=
o one or more account recovery methods. See https://docs.github.com/articles/=
configuring-two-factor-authentication-recovery-methods in the GitHub Help.

Thanks,
The GitHub Team
